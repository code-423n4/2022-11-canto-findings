## Low

### withdraw incorrect to spec

According to README
```
Users are lazily allocated fees. This means that each user withdraws all fees they have accrued since the last time they have withdrawn from a NFT.
```
Instead of `all` fees, the withdraw function allow the user to specify the `_amount` to withdraw.

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 _tokenId, address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount)
        public
        onlyNftOwner(_tokenId)
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 earnedFees = balances[_tokenId];

        if (earnedFees == 0 || _amount == 0) revert NothingToWithdraw();
        if (_amount > earnedFees) _amount = earnedFees;

        balances[_tokenId] = earnedFees - _amount;

        emit Withdraw(_tokenId, _recipient, _amount);

        Address.sendValue(_recipient, _amount);

        return _amount;
    }
```

## Non-critical

### Unnecessary owner check

It doesn't seems to do any harm if this function is permissionless, then the contract don't even need `Ownable`

```solidity
    function distributeFees(uint256 _tokenId) public onlyOwner payable {

```

### Events lack indexed field

Add indexed fields for easier analytics

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/blob/2733fdd1bee73a6871c6243f92a007a0b80e4c61/CIP-001/src/Turnstile.sol#L28-L31

```solidity
    event Register(address smartContract, address recipient, uint256 tokenId);
    event Assign(address smartContract, uint256 tokenId);
    event Withdraw(uint256 tokenId, address recipient, uint256 feeAmount);
    event DistributeFees(uint256 tokenId, uint256 feeAmount);
```
