Events Indexing
Events should use the maximum amount of indexed fields: up to three parameters. This makes it easier to filter for specific values in front-ends.

Proof of Concept

Recommended Mitigation Steps Add indexed fields to these events so that they have the maximum number of indexed fields possible.

Using bools for storage incurs overhead
Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled. https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/58f635312aa21f947cae5f8578638a85aa2519f5/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L23-L27 Use uint256(1) and uint256(2) for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (100 gas) for the extra SLOAD, and to avoid Gsset (20000 gas) when changing from 'false' to 'true', after having been 'true' in the past
